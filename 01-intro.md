There will be two repos for a full stack dapp :
1) The one containing all the contracts
2) The one with the frontend

Extensions::

1) All extensions get embedded into the browser's window object.
2) These extensions add few properties to the window object. Eg metamask adds window.ethereum which is the same as importing hardhat 

==> Metamask/Wallets is just a way to connect to the node of a blockchain.
